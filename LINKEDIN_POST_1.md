🎵 Proud to share my latest projects from CodeAlpha internship!

Just built two production-ready web applications:

🎵 MUSIC PLAYER
• Spotify-inspired dark theme with glassmorphism
• Full CRUD playlist management (Add, Edit, Delete)
• Real-time search & filtering by title/artist
• Smooth progress bar with seeking functionality
• Dynamic volume control with icon changes
• Memory-efficient audio playback
• Fully responsive design (desktop/tablet/mobile)

🧮 ADVANCED CALCULATOR
• Modern glassmorphism design with dark theme
• Memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC)
• Full keyboard support (Enter, Backspace, Escape)
• Percentage calculations
• Calculation history tracking
• Responsive on all devices
• Smooth hover animations

Both feature:
✅ Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript (NO frameworks)
✅ Smooth animations & transitions
✅ Professional UI/UX design
✅ Production-ready, well-commented code
✅ 40+ JSDoc comments explaining logic
✅ Full keyboard accessibility
✅ Error handling & edge cases
✅ Cross-browser compatible

Tech Stack:
• HTML5 semantic markup
• CSS3 (Grid, Flexbox, Gradients, Animations)
• Vanilla JavaScript (DOM manipulation, Event handling)
• Font Awesome Icons (CDN)

I learned so much about:
→ DOM manipulation & event delegation
→ CSS animations & responsive design
→ Git & version control
→ Code organization & best practices
→ State management in vanilla JS

Both projects are live and open-source on GitHub!
